    <p>
      This project is a <strong>settler-style resource management and village-building game</strong>
      developed in <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> using <strong>C++</strong> during my
      <strong>3rd semester</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player assigns workers to houses and production buildings, generates resources such as
      wood and stone, and uses those resources to construct new structures and expand the settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core gameplay loop focuses on <strong>worker assignment, simple economy management and progression</strong>.
      The main goal is to continuously expand the village and eventually construct the
      <strong>City Hall</strong>, which acts as the final milestone while still allowing continued play afterwards.
