  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="content-inner">

    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Per</strong>, a <strong>Game Programmer</strong> with a strong interest in
      gameplay systems, technical problem-solving, and building interactive experiences from the ground up.
      I recently completed my studies in <strong>Games Programming</strong> and am currently looking to
      start my professional career in the games industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my studies, I worked with <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>,
      primarily using <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong>.
      My projects range from small 1st semester prototypes to more advanced 3rd semester projects,
      including a resource management game in Unreal Engine and multiple C++ console-based applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy working on <strong>gameplay mechanics</strong> such as player movement, combat systems,
      resource management, progression systems, and procedural elements.
      I am especially interested in understanding how systems interact with each other
      and how small design decisions affect the overall player experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a personal standpoint, I consider myself a <strong>reliable team player</strong>
      who communicates clearly and values constructive feedback.
      I enjoy collaborating with designers and fellow programmers and feel comfortable
      explaining technical concepts in a clear and structured way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am highly <strong>self-motivated</strong> and curious, and I like to expand my skill set
      by building focused side projects or iterating on existing systems.
      Learning new tools, engines, or programming concepts is something I actively seek out,
      both during structured projects and in my own time.
    </p>

    <p>
      My portfolio projects were created across multiple semesters:
      from a <strong>Unity-based 2D platformer in C# (1st semester)</strong>,
      to a <strong>C# AVL tree implementation (2nd semester)</strong>,
      and <strong>C++ console projects and a settler-style resource management game in Unreal Engine (3rd semester)</strong>.
      Each project was designed to explore specific technical or gameplay-focused topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am open to learning new technologies, adapting to existing codebases,
      and relocating or working internationally.
      My goal is to grow as a developer while contributing meaningful, well-structured code
      to a professional game development team.
